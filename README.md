# Wedding RSVP — GitHub Pages Template

This is a clean, fast, no-compression template you can deploy on **GitHub Pages**. Replace the placeholder images with your high-quality photos to avoid Wix-style compression.

## 🚀 Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g., `rsvp`).
2. Upload these files (or push via Git).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to `main` and **/ (root)`**.
4. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## 🖼 Replace images
- Put your hero photo at `images/hero.jpg` (3200×1800 or similar).  
- Update `<img src="images/hero-placeholder.svg">` in `index.html` to `images/hero.jpg`.
- Replace `images/stack-1.svg` and `images/stack-2.svg` with your own (prefer 2000px on the long edge).

### Image quality tips
- Export at **2× the display size** for crispness on retina screens.
- Use **JPEG (quality 80–90%)** for photos; **PNG** for graphics; **SVG** for logos.
- Keep individual images under **2–3 MB** for fast loads.

## ✉️ RSVP form
This template uses [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/).  
- In `index.html`, change `YOUR_EMAIL_HERE` to your email.
- The first time someone submits, FormSubmit will send a confirmation email to verify you own the address.

**Alternative:** link to a Google Form instead of using the built-in form—replace the whole `<form>` block with a button linking to your form.

## 🧰 Customize
- Edit text in `index.html` (Wedding details, story, etc.).
- Styles in `assets/css/styles.css`.
- Minimal JS in `assets/js/main.js`.

## 🔒 Privacy
This site is static. There’s no tracking unless you add it. Images are served exactly as you upload them.
